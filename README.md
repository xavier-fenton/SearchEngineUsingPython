## Steps to follow

A simple search engine using Python and Django, you'll need to take the following steps:

1. Gather the data: You can use web crawling techniques to extract data from websites. You can use libraries such as BeautifulSoup and Requests to extract HTML data from websites.

2. Store the data: You can store the extracted data in a database such as Django's built-in database (SQLite or PostgreSQL), or a NoSQL database like MongoDB.

3. Build the search engine: You can use Django's ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to search the database and retrieve relevant information. You can also use the Whoosh library to implement full-text search in your Django application.

4. Build the web interface: You can use Django's views and templates to build a web interface for your search engine.

5. Deploy the application: Once your application is ready, you can deploy it to a web server or hosting service to make it accessible to the public.

These are the basic steps to build a simple search engine using Python and Django. You can add more functionality and improve the performance of your application as per your requirements.
